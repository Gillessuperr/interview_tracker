# interview_tracker
This code is designed to help someone keep track of interviews they have conducted.

Overall, this code is a useful tool for keeping track of interviews and their associated questions and answers. However, it could be improved by adding error handling for cases where the user enters invalid input, such as a non-integer value for the number of interviews or number of questions. Additionally, the code could be made more efficient by using a dictionary to store the questions and answers for each interviewee instead of two separate lists.
